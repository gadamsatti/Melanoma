# Project Name
Melanoma Detection 

## Problem 
Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis


## Conclusions

**Summary**
*   when we started with model one it has been overfitted as it was trained with all the parameters.
*   Due to that we added Dropout and reshaped the images now the model was stable but not able to predict accuratly.
*  when we visialised the data we understand the classes were imbalenced so we used Augmentor to balance the images and retrained the model by adding Batch Normalisation after that it was able to perform well. !!
